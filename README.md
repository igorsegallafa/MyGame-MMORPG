# Urho MMO
###### Incomplete project, only for studies.

Features I've started:
* Scene replication (client <> server)
* Networking base (client and server)
* Configuration files (ini parser)
* Server separate on login server and game servers
* Net server to make communication between all servers
* Some structures already defined on server, like user, character, account, map
* Game using multiple screens (login screen, character screen and world screen)
* Character and account handler defined on server

*I don't have any intention to finish this project, I used this just to learn the basic of game coding.*
